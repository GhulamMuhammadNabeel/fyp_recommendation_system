Step-Video-T2V,"**Abstract**  
Step-Video-T2V introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity text-to-video generation that leverages a step-aware training strategy to improve temporal coherence and visual quality. By decomposing video synthesis into semantically meaningful denoising steps and incorporating motion priors at each stage, our model generates temporally consistent, high-resolution videos aligned with complex textual prompts. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, with significant gains in motion smoothness and semantic fidelity. The proposed approach offers a scalable and controllable paradigm for controllable video generation from text.",Multiple / Unknown,"diffusion-based framework, step-aware training strategy, motion priors, denoising steps",2024.0,https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Video-T2V,"Step-Video-T2V | **Abstract**

By iteratively refining depth predictions using an ensemble of lightweight corrective networks trained on residual errors, our method effectively mitigates common failure modes such as scale ambiguity, textureless regions, and object boundaries. Leveraging self-supervised learning and adaptive weighting mechanisms, BoostingMonocularDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks (NYU Depth V2 and KITTI), outperforming existing single-model and ensemble approaches while maintaining real-time inference efficiency.

Credit-Card-Reader-Using-Facial-Recognition,"**Abstract**  
This study presents a secure and user-friendly credit card payment system integrated with facial recognition technology. The proposed framework replaces or supplements traditional authentication methods (e.g., PINs or signatures) by leveraging real-time facial verification to authenticate users during transactions. Utilizing deep learning–based face detection and recognition algorithms, the system ensures high accuracy and robustness against spoofing attacks. Experimental results demonstrate reliable performance under varying lighting and pose conditions, with strong privacy safeguards for biometric data.

Lung-Cancer-detection-from-Radiology-Images-CNN,"**Abstract**  
This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the automated detection of lung cancer from radiology images, including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. Leveraging a curated dataset of annotated medical images, the proposed model extracts hierarchical features to classify malignant and benign lesions with high accuracy. Preprocessing techniques, such as image normalization and data augmentation, are employed to enhance model robustness and address class imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving high sensitivity and specificity in lung cancer identification. The findings underscore the potential of deep learning in assisting radiologists for early and accurate diagnosis, contributing to improved clinical outcomes.

genetic_greedy_algorithm,"**Abstract**  
This study introduces a hybrid optimization framework, termed *Genetic Greedy Algorithm* (GGA), which integrates the global search capabilities of genetic algorithms with the local refinement strengths of greedy heuristics. Designed to address complex combinatorial optimization problems, GGA leverages genetic operators—selection, crossover, and mutation—to explore diverse solution spaces, while embedding a greedy constructive mechanism within the evolutionary loop to enhance solution quality and convergence speed. Experimental evaluations on benchmark instances, including the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack Problem, demonstrate that GGA achieves superior performance compared to standalone genetic and greedy approaches, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively. The results highlight GGA’s robustness, scalability, and potential for application in real-world optimization domains.",Multiple / Unknown,"Genetic Algorithm, Greedy Algorithm",2024.0,https://github.com/zhorahmatt/genetic_greedy_algorithm,"genetic_greedy_algorithm | **Abstract**
